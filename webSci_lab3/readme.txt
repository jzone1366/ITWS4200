Lab 3 - Git and Bug Tracking

Thoughts:
	Source Control is very important in the software developemnt lifecycle. This allows many developers in many different locations to be able to collaborate on an application. Bug Tracking tied in to that also allows the developers to be able to see where the bugs occur and then branch off of the repository to address a bug without disrupting the Production environment. There are many different types of bug trackers out there that do a myriad of things rather than just track issues and bugs. Using Git is pretty straight forward. I have been using it for a few years for all of my development projects. I actually prefer to use the command line tools rather than a GUI since I spend the majority of my time typing rather than using the mouse.

Bug Tracking:
	We Chose to use GitHub Issue Tracking for out Bug Tracking. Integration with our source code is simple since our repository is hosted on GitHub. It will also allow us to give access to the public to put in issues as well. There is also a public interface that allows public users to add bugs that they may encounter. It's also a central location for the team of developers to look at rather than having to look in multiple locations. 

Server:
	The Application will be hosted on a Virtual Private Server which is hosted by Digital Ocean. Below is the IP address of the server.
